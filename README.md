This repository contains the code used on the jono20201.com website.

It's a simple site, and is purposely not very complicated. I didn't see any need to include any javascript and only simple CSS is contained within the `index.html` file.

The site itself is hosted on AWS. The code and assets are stored with S3, with CloudFront in front.

No compilation needed to run!
